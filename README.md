# The Mechanics of Proof

This repository contains the Lean code for the book [The Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001), by [Heather Macbeth](https://faculty.fordham.edu/hmacbeth1), developed for the course Math 2001 at Fordham University.

The Lean files corresponding to each chapter of the book are in the folder [`Math2001`](https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001/tree/main/Math2001).

I'm working through this, using content I'm already familiar with to teach myself Lean4 and to track my own progress. I cannot guarantee I will solve everything here because that would be very tedious.
